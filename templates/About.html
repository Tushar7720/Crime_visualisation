                            Recent days have witnessed a rise in criminal activities. considering that it makes it only reasonable to understand crime patterns to understand what branches of crime need more attention. So this wensite aims at helping lawmakers and police to indentify loopholes and crime sections that need their immediate attention.
                        our website aims to predict the rise or drop in 4 different types of mojor crime branches being : SLL crimes, crimes against women, Crime against children and IPC crimes. These trends and better understood by visualising them with special graphs plotted against crime rates and literacy rates to understnd the effect of literacy on different crimes.
                        not only this major project gave us an opportunity to build something useful but also gave a chance to utilise all we have learnt so far in our Bachelors including python, machine learning, Statistical analysis , HMTL, CSS and javascript.
